Middleware are a series of functions that are executed during an HTTP request before it reaches the route handler. Every function in the chain has the ability to end the request or forward it to the `next` function.

You can use middleware for various use cases, like

- A middleware to log HTTP requests.
- An auth middleware to ensure user is authenticated and abort the request for unauthenticated users.
- A middleware to time HTTP requests
- and much more

## Basic Example

The simplest way to test a middleware is to attach it to the route using the `Route.middleware` method. For example:

```ts
Route.get('/users/:id', async () => {
  return 'Show user'
})
  // highlight-start
  .middleware(async (ctx, next) => {
    console.log(`Inside middleware ${ctx.request.url()}`)
    await next()
  })
// highlight-end
```

## Middleware classes

Writing middleware as inline closures is fine for some quick testing. However, we recommend extracting them to their own classes and then registering them inside the `start/kernel.ts` file.

### Make middleware command

You can create a middleware by running the following ace command.

```sh
node ace make:middleware LogRequest

# CREATE: app/Middleware/LogRequest.ts
```

### About middleware class

Middleware classes are stored (but not limited to) inside the `app/Middleware` directory and each file represents a single middleware. For example:

```ts{app/Middleware/LogRequest.ts}
import { HttpContextContract } from '@ioc:Adonis/Core/HttpContext'

export default class LogRequest {
  public async handle(
    { request }: HttpContextContract,
    next: () => Promise<void>
  ) {
    console.log(`-> ${request.method()}: ${request.url()}`)
    await next()
  }
}
```

- Every middleware class must implement the `handle` method.
- The `handle` method receives the HTTP context as the first argument and a `next` function.
- Make sure to always call the `next` function in order to advance the middleware chain.
- You can terminate the request by either raising an exception or by sending a response without calling the `next` method.
  ```ts
  export default class LogRequest {
    public async handle({ response }: HttpContextContract, next: () => Promise<void>) {
      response.send('Handled by middleware')
      // Make sure to not call `next` when decided to
      // send the response
    }
  }
  ```

### Registering middleware

For the middleware to take effect, it must be registered as a **global middleware** or a **named middleware** inside the `start/kernel.ts` file.

Let's register the `LogRequest` middleware as a global middleware. As the name suggest, the global middleware are executed on every HTTP request.

:::note
Global middleware are executed only for the requests with a registered route. In other words, if a request comes in for an non-existing route, then the middleware will not be executed.
:::

```ts{start/kernel.ts}
Server.middleware.register([
  () => import('@ioc:Adonis/Core/BodyParserMiddleware'),
  // highlight-start
  () => import('App/Middleware/LogRequest')
  // highlight-end
])
```
