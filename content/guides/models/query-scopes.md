Query scopes are the reusable function to apply to a query builder instance to modify the query.

The methods are defined as static properties on the model class and receive the current query as the first argument. For example:

```ts
// title: app/Models/Post.ts
import { DateTime } from 'luxon'

import {
  BaseModel,
  column,
  scope // ðŸ‘ˆ import scope method
} from '@ioc:Adonis/Lucid/Orm'

export default class Post extends BaseModel {
  public static published = scope((query) => {
    query.where('publishedOn', '<=', DateTime.utc().toSQLDate())
  })
}
```

You can apply the `published` scope on a query using the `withScopes` method. It accepts a callback and gives you access to all the scopes as methods.

```ts
Post
  .query()
  .withScopes((scopes) => scopes.published())
```

### Passing arguments to the scopes
The query scopes can also accept arguments. For example: Creating a scope that accepts a user object to scope the projects they can view.

```ts
import { DateTime } from 'luxon'
import User from 'App/Models/User'
import { BaseModel, column, scope } from '@ioc:Adonis/Lucid/Orm'

export default class Project extends BaseModel {

  public static visibleTo = scope((query, user: User) => {
    if (user.isAdmin) {
      return
    }

    /**
     * Non-admin users can only view their own team's projects
     */
    query.where('teamId', user.teamId)
  })

}
```

Now, you can call the `scopes.visibleTo` method and pass it the required arguments.

```ts
Project
  .query()
  .withScopes((scopes) => scopes.visibleTo(auth.user))
```
